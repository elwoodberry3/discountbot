# Content.js  

Key Points in the Code
Event Listener: The DOMContentLoaded event ensures that the script runs only after the HTML has been completely loaded and parsed.

Element Selection: The getElementById method is used to find the existing footer div.

Creating a New Element: A new <div> is created using document.createElement(), and its text content is set appropriately.

Inserting the New Element: The insertAdjacentElement method allows you to place the new <div> directly after the specified footer.
